# Question 1
# Write an expression that calculates the average of 23, 32 and 64
# Place the expression in this print statement
print((23+32+64)/3)

# Question 2
# In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
print(9*7 + 5*7)

# You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print((17*6)-(9*7+5*7))

# Note that this code uses scientific notation to define large numbers. 4.445e8 is equal to 4.445 * 10 ** 8 which is equal to 444500000.0.

# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall *= .90

# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume += rainfall

# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# into the reservoir in the days following the storm
reservoir_volume *= 1.05

# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume *= .95

# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# that's piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume -= 2.5e5

# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)

# Quiz 3: Strings
##########################################################################

# Question 1: You’ll be provided with example data for a user, the time of their visit and the site they accessed. You should use the variables provided and the techniques you’ve learned to print a log message like this one (with the username, url, and timestamp replaced with values from the appropriate variables):
# Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20.

username = "Kinari"
timestamp = "04:50"
url = "http://petshop.com/pets/mammals/cats"

# TODO: print a log message using the variables above.
# The message should have the same format as this one:
# "Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20."
print(username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + ".")
 
# Question 2: Use string concatenation and the len() function to find the length of a certain movie star's actual full name. Store that length in the name_length variable. Don't forget that there are spaces in between the different parts of a name!
given_name = "William"
middle_names = "Bradley"
family_name = "Pitt"

#todo: calculate how long this name is
name_length = len(given_name + ' ' +  middle_names + ' ' + family_name)
# Alternate Solution: name_length = len(given_name + middle_names + family_name) + 2

# Now we check to make sure that the name fits within the driving license character limit
# Nothing you need to do here
driving_license_character_limit = 28
print(name_length <= driving_license_character_limit)

# Question 1: Calculate and print the total sales for the week from the data provided. Print out a string of the form "This week's total sales: xxx", where xxx will be the actual total of all the numbers. You’ll need to change the type of the input data in order to calculate that total.

mon_sales = "121"
tues_sales = "105"
wed_sales = "110"
thurs_sales = "98"

#TODO: Print a string with this format: This week's total sales: xxx
# You will probably need to write some lines of code before the print statement.
total_sales = int(mon_sales) + int(tues_sales) + int(wed_sales) + int(thurs_sales) + int(fri_sales)
print("This week's total sales: " + str(total_sales))

# What is the index of the last occurrence of the word 'you' in verse?
# What is the count of occurrences of the word 'you' in the verse?
