"""
Iterables are objects that can return one of their elements at a time, such as a list. Many of the built-in functions weâ€™ve used so far, like 'enumerate,' return an iterator.

An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. This is different from a list, which is also an iterable, but is not an iterator because it is not a stream of data.

Generators are a simple way to create iterators using functions. You can also define iterators using classes, which you can read more about here. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators

Why should I use generators? https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-and-why-you-should-use-python-generators-f6fb56650888/#:~:text=In%20summary%E2%80%A6%201%20Generators%20allow%20you%20to%20create,are%20better%20than%20Iterators%20%28for%20simple%20cases%20only%29.

# Quiz 1: Implement my_enumerate

QUESTION 1:

Write your own generator function my_enumerate that works like the built-in function enumerate.

Calling your function like this:

lessons = ["Why Python Programming", "Data Types and Operators", "Control Flow", "Functions", "Scripting"]

for i, lesson in my_enumerate(lessons, 1):
    print("Lesson {}: {}".format(i, lesson))


should output:

Lesson 1: Why Python Programming
Lesson 2: Data Types and Operators
Lesson 3: Control Flow
Lesson 4: Functions
Lesson 5: Scripting

# while loop solution:
def my_enumerate(iterable, start=0):
    # Implement your generator function here
    i = 0
    while i < len(iterable):
        yield (start+i, iterable[i])
        i += 

# for loop solution:

    print("Lesson {}: {}".format(i, lesson))

QUESTION 2:

If you have an iterable that is too large to fit in memory in full (e.g., when dealing with large files), being able to take and use chunks of it at a time can be very valuable.

Implement a generator function, chunker, that takes in an iterable and yields a chunk of a specified size at a time.

Calling the function like this:

for chunk in chunker(range(25), 4):
    print(list(chunk))
should output:

[0, 1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6, 7]
[8, 9, 10, 11]
[12, 13, 14, 15]
[16, 17, 18, 19]
[20, 21, 22, 23]
[24]
"""

def chunker(iterable, size):
    # while loop solution:
    i=0
    while i < len(iterable):
        end = i + size
        yield iterable[i:end]
        i = end
    
    # for loop solution:
    # def chunker(iterable, size):
    # """Yield successive chunks from iterable of length size."""
    # for i in range(0, len(iterable), size):
    #    yield iterable[i:i + size]

for chunk in chunker(range(25), 4):
    print(list(chunk))

"""
Here's a cool concept that combines generators and list comprehensions! You can actually create a generator in the same way you'd normally write a list comprehension, except with parentheses instead of square brackets. For example:

sq_list = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # this produces a list of squares

sq_iterator = (x**2 for x in range(10))  # this produces an iterator of squares
This can help you save time and create efficient code!
