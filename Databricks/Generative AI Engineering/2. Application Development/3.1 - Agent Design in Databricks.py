# # Agent Design in Databricks
#
# In the previous demo, we build a multi-stage AI system by manually stitching them together. With Agents, we can build the same system in an autonomous way. An agent, typically, has a brain which make the decisions, a planning outline and tools to use. 
#
# In this demo, we will create two types of agents. The first agent will use **a search engine, Wikipedia, and Youtube** to recommend a movie, collect data about the movie and show the trailer video. 
#
# The second agent is a verys specific type agent; it will allow us to "talk with data" using natural language queries. 
#
# **Learning Objectives:**
#
# *By the end of this demo, you will be able to;*
#
# * Build semi-automated systems with LLM agents to perform internet searches and dataset analysis using LangChain.
#
# * Use appropriate tool for the agent task to be achieved.
#
# * Explore LangChain’s built-in agents for specific, advanced workflows.
#
# * Create a Pandas DataFrame Agent to interact with a Pandas DataFrame as needed.

# ## Requirements
#
# Please review the following requirements before starting the lesson:
#
# * To run this notebook, you need to use one of the following Databricks runtime(s): **14.3.x-cpu-ml-scala2.12 14.3.x-scala2.12**
#

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Classroom Setup
#
# Before starting the demo, run the provided classroom setup script. This script will define configuration variables necessary for the demo. Execute the following cell:

# %%
# %pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain==0.2.11 langchain-community==0.2.10 langchain-experimental==0.0.64 youtube_search wikipedia==1.4.0 duckduckgo-search==6.2.5 mlflow==2.14.3 pydantic==2.8.2 cloudpickle==2.2.1

dbutils.library.restartPython()

# %%
# %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-04

# %% [markdown]
# **Other Conventions:**
#
# Throughout this demo, we'll refer to the object `DA`. This object, provided by Databricks Academy, contains variables such as your username, catalog name, schema name, working directory, and dataset locations. Run the code block below to view these details:

# %%
print(f"Username:          {DA.username}")
print(f"Catalog Name:      {DA.catalog_name}")
print(f"Schema Name:       {DA.schema_name}")
print(f"Working Directory: {DA.paths.working_dir}")
print(f"Dataset Location:  {DA.paths.datasets}")

# ## Enable MLflow Auto-Log
#
# MLflow has support for auto-logging LangChain models. We will enable this below.
#

# %%
import mlflow
mlflow.langchain.autolog()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Create an Autonomous Agent (Brixo 🤖)
#
# In the previous demo, we create chains using various prompts and tools combinations go solve a problem defined by the prompt. In chains, we need to define the input parameters and prompts. 
#
# In this demo, we will create an agent that can **autonomously reason** about the steps to take and select **the tools** to use for each task.
#
# **🤖 Agent name: Brixo :)**
#
# **✅ Agent Abilities: This agent can help you by suggesting fun activities, pick videos and even write code.**

# %% [markdown]
# ### Define the Brain of the Agent
#
# LLM is the brain of the agent. We will use **Databricks' DBRX model** as the brain of our agent.

# %%

# play with max_tokens to define the length of the response
llm_dbrx = ChatDatabricks(endpoint="databricks-dbrx-instruct", max_tokens = 500)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Define Tools that the Agent Can Use
#
# Agent can use various tools for completing a task. Here we will define the tools that can be used by **Brixo 🤖**.

# ### Define Planning Logic
#
# While working on tasks, our agent will need to done some reasoning and planning. We can define the format of this plan by passing a prompt.

# %%
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin!

Question: {input}

# ### Create the Agent
#
# The final step is to put all these together and build an agent.

    Second, show me the trailer video of the movie that you suggest. 

    Next, collect data about the movie using search tool and  draw a bar chart using Python libraries. If you can't find latest data use some dummy data as we to show your abilities to the learners. Don't use ``` for python code. Input should be sanitized by removing any leading or trailing backticks. if the input starts with ”python”, remove that word as well. The output must be the result of executed code.

# ## Conclusion
#
# In this demo, we explored agent design in Databricks, moving beyond manual system stitching to autonomous agent-based systems. Agents, equipped with decision-making branches, planning outlines, and tools, streamline the process. We created two types of agents: one utilizing a search engine, Wikipedia, and YouTube to recommend movies and another enabling natural language data queries. By leveraging LangChain's capabilities, participants learned to build semi-automated systems, choose appropriate tools, and utilize built-in agents for advanced workflows, including interacting with Pandas DataFrames.
