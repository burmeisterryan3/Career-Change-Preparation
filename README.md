# Career-Change--Preparation

## _Journey of Rediscovery_

What is this repository? This is a small base of code for various coures and tutorials I've taken to refresh and learn knew skills. I'm currently a U.S. Navy Officer with the goal of transitioning into the private sector sometime in the middle of 2024. Broadly speaking, my goal is to (re)learn the suite of tools and skills of a seasoned software developer while learning cloud offerings, with the goal of narrowing into the data and software engineering disciplines.

Prior to my time in the Navy, I published a paper in the International Conference of Machine Learning and had a poster submission to the Nueral Information Processing Systems Conference while an undergraduate at the United States Naval Academy in the prestigious [Trident Scholar Program](https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/Trident%20Scholar%20Classes/Class%20of%202016.php). My focus on machine learning led to time studying in Rice University's [Digital Signal Processing Lab](http://dsp.rice.edu/) where I did research for [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) using NLP and machine learning to improve student learning outcomes.
