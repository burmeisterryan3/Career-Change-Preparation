# Career-Change--Preparation

## _Journey of Rediscovery_

What is this repository? This is a small base of code for various coures and tutorials I've taken to refresh and learn knew skills. I'm currently a U.S. Navy Officer with the goal of transitioning into the private sector sometime in the middle of 2024. Broadly speaking, my goal is to (re)learn the full-stack of web development while learning cloud offerings, with the goal of narrowing into the data engineering and data science disciplines.
