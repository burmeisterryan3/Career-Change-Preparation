    "# Design of Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations are bad when they *hide*, *distract*, or *mislead*.\n",

    "### Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building a visualization, it is important to know the type of data you are dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Qualitative vs Quantitative\n",
    "\n",
    "* Qualitative/Categorical\n",
    "    * Nominal\n",
    "        * No inherent order to data\n",
    "        * Examples: Gender, marital status, zip code, breakfast items, emotions, etc.\n",
    "    * Ordinal\n",
    "        * Intrinsic order or ranking but no well-defined magnitude of difference between each value\n",
    "        * Examples: Letter grade, podium ranking, survey ratings, etc.\n",
    "* Quantitative/Numeric\n",
    "    * Interval\n",
    "        * Numeric values where absolute differences between values are meaningful (i.e., can add and subtract)\n",
    "    * Ratio\n",
    "        * Numeric values where relative differences between values are meaningful (i.e., can multiply & divide)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative variables can also be divided into *discrete* and *continuous*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quantitative - Discrete vs Continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discrete\n",
    "    * Quantitative variables can only take on a specific set of values at some maximum level of precision (e.g., integers)\n",
    "    * Examples: Pages in a book, trees in a yard, dogs at a coffee shop\n",
    "* Continuous\n",
    "    * Quantitative variables can (hypothetically) take on values to any level of precision (e.g., real numbers)\n",
    "    * Examples: Height, age, income\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Likert Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Likert scale data may also be data you encounter. Technically, responses on these types of questions should be considered *ordinal*. However, it might not be the case that differences in consecutive levels are consistent in size. However, in order to simply analyses, Likert data is often treated as *interval* data.\n",

    "Alternatively, humans *struggle* with understanding data encoded with **color hue changes** (as are unfortunately commonly used as an additional variable encoding in scatter plots - we'll study this in upcoming concepts) and **area** or **area changes** (as we see in pie charts, which often makes them not the best plot choice).\n",
