    "* OOP allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time.\n",

    "* **class** - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes\n",
    "* **object** - an *instance* of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc.\n",
    "* **attribute** - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.\n",
    "* **method** - an action that a class or object could take\n",
    "* **encapsulation** - the ability to combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms."
