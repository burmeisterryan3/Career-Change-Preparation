    "* `csv`: very convenient for reading and writing csv files\n",
    "* `collections`: useful extensions of the usual data types including OrderedDict, defaultdict and namedtuple\n",
    "* `random`: generates pseudo-random numbers, shuffles sequences randomly and chooses random items\n",
    "* `string`: more functions on strings. This module also contains useful collections of letters like string.digits (a string containing all characters which are valid digits).\n",
    "* `re`: pattern-matching in strings via regular expressions\n",
    "* `math`: some standard mathematical functions\n",
    "* `os`: interacting with operating systems\n",
    "* `os.path`: submodule of os for manipulating path names\n",
    "* `sys`: work directly with the Python interpreter\n",
    "* `json`: good for reading and writing json files (good for web work)\n",
