    "3. How many different 5-letter words can be formed using the letters from A to J (10 letters) such that each word has at least one letter repeated.\n",

    "The total number of arrangement of students is $^{10}P_{10} = 10!$.  \n",
    "The number of arrangements where Jack and Daniel are together can be computed by treating them as a single unit. Thus, these 9 entities can be arranged in $^9P_9=9!$ ways. However, we must also consider the ways Jack and Daniel themselves can be permuted, which is $2!$ or 2 ways. Thus, the total number of ways in which Jack and Daniel are together is $2*9!$.  \n",

    "A Markov chain (or Markov process) is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Informally, this may be thought of as, \"What happens next depends only on the state of affairs ***now***.\n",

Predictions can be made regarding future outcomes based solely on its present state and, such predictions, are just as good as the ones that could be made knowing the process's full history. Stated another way, the Markov property is such that, conditioned on the current state, the past and future states it will occupy are conditionally independent.\n",

    "\n",
    "A [stationary distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process) for a Markov chain satisfies the following characteristic: $\\pi=\\pi P$, where a $P$ is a transition matrix and remains fixed following any transitions using $P$. Thus, $P$ contains the long-run proportions of the time that a process will spend in any particular state over time."
