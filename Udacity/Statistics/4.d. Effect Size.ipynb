    "# Effect Size\n",
    "\n",
    "In experiemental studies or studies iwth a treatment variable, effect size refers to the size of a treatment effect. In non-experimental studies, effect size may refer to the strength of the relationship between our variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a z-test or t-test, the simplest measure for effect size is the mean difference, i.e., difference between two means. The mean difference in a z-test or one sample t-test is $\\bar{x}-\\mu$. Mean differences are great when we have variables with easy to understand meanings that do not require domain expertise.\n",

    "    * The lower the significance level, the lower the power of the test. If you reduce the significance level (e.g., 0.05 to 0.01), the region of acceptance gets bigger. As a result, you are less likely to reject the null hypothesis. This is true even when $H_0$ is false, so you are more likely to make a Type II error.\n",

    "    * The greater the difference between the \"true\" value of a parameer and the value specified in $H_0$, the greater the power of the test. That is, the greater the effect size, the greater the power of the test."
