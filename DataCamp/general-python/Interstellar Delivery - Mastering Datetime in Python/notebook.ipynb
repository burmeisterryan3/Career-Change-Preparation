Since you're still in the startup phase, you're handling everything yourself, including writing the software to manage complex scheduling and timing across different space colonies.\n\nBefore developing a full rocket flight planning and logistics system, you want to create core functions using Python's datetime module to handle dates, times, and durations. These basic functions are essential for your rocket delivery service. In this project, you will make simple reusable functions for working with timestamps, calculating rocket landing times based on launch and travel duration, and figuring out days until a delivery deadline to keep those customers updated!\n\nThis project is data-less, but you can test your functions by calling them in the workspace and passing them the required variables.","metadata":{},"id":"d23e9759-c345-4665-9b02-eaf3932cfa51","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":9,"lastExecutedAt":1716171155216,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta","lastExecutedByKernel":"ae673e09-5623-480c-bd3b-29a7735225cb"},"id":"b73875a4-ec41-4739-8670-764f75f2804f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":90,"outputs":[]},{"source":"### Problem 1\n\nDefine a function called `format_date()`, which formats a timestamp into a readable datetime string.\n\n* It should accept two parameters: `timestamp` - the Unix timestamp integer, and `datetime_format` - a string specifying the desired date format.\n* The function should return the date correctly formatted as a string.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4dd42712-9c8f-44aa-9aa7-7e2f55c50acb"},{"source":"def format_date(timestamp, datetime_format):\n    return datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp).strftime(datetime_format)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":47,"lastExecutedAt":1716171155263,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"def format_date(timestamp, datetime_format):\n    return datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp).strftime(datetime_format)","lastExecutedByKernel":"ae673e09-5623-480c-bd3b-29a7735225cb"},"id":"b79a3cde-42f2-48da-879c-af8bbafa6a2e","cell_type":"code","execution_count":91,"outputs":[]},{"source":"### Problem 2\n\nDefine a function called `calculate_landing_time()`, which calculates the estimated landing time.\n\n* It should accept two parameters: `rocket_launch_dt` - the rocket launch datetime object, and `travel_duration` - the expected travel time in days as an integer.\n* The function should return the estimated Mars landing time as a datetime string in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4dd559c8-80a8-4fba-b63e-bb9bd7943ffa"},{"source":"def calculate_landing_time(rocket_launch_dt, travel_duration):\n    return (rocket_launch_dt + timedelta(days=travel_duration)).strftime('%d-%m-%Y')","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":48,"lastExecutedAt":1716171155311,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ae673e09-5623-480c-bd3b-29a7735225cb","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"def calculate_landing_time(rocket_launch_dt, travel_duration):\n    return (rocket_launch_dt + timedelta(days=travel_duration)).strftime('%d-%m-%Y')","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"cell_type":"code","id":"f3bb4d04-351b-4370-90f8-0f6e75c1faa7","outputs":[],"execution_count":92},{"source":"### Problem 3\n\nDefine a function named `days_until_delivery()`, which calculates the days until a package arrives for customers.\n\n* It accepts two parameters: `expected_delivery_dt` - the estimated delivery date as a datetime object for the package, and `current_dt` - the current date as a datetime object.\n* The function should calculate the difference in days between the expected delivery datetime and the current datetime, then return the number of days remaining as an integer.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3b51ee8b-90cf-4c17-8c7c-fa8378d4320c"},{"source":"def days_until_delivery(expected_delivery_dt, current_dt):\n    return (expected_delivery_dt - current_dt).days","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":48,"lastExecutedAt":1716171155360,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ae673e09-5623-480c-bd3b-29a7735225cb","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"def days_until_delivery(expected_delivery_dt, current_dt):\n    return (expected_delivery_dt - current_dt).days"},"cell_type":"code","id":"5ead98df-3d9a-45e4-a60e-76f80f44b88f","outputs":[],"execution_count":93}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
